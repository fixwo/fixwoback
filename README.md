# fixwoback
The Fixwo Backend.

Fixwo is the tool to report issues for geolocated or QRCode identified places.

Fixwo was created by the students in the final project of the Programming Languages III classes at University of Lavras. The goal
of the project was to exploit the worlds of:

1. agile development frameworks
2. modularized process oriented development
3. model driven engineering
4. dynamic languages
5. cross-platform mobile app development
6. maps and geolocated applications

The students were divided in four teams:

1. cross-platform mobile app,
2. AngularJS frontend,
3. backend process services, and
4. backend data services

This is fixwoback project, which includes backend process and data services. Some technologies used are:

1. Groovy language and Grails 3 framework
2. jBPM 6.4 BPMS
3. EasyBPMS process integration
4. Bitronix global transaction management
5. PostgreSQL

The first version of fixwo is coming soon. After the first version, the project will accept new collaborators.
